# Hi, I’m Gazali Ahmad

## What I Do

I work at the intersection of data analysis, systems thinking, and operational reality.

My focus is not on maximising metrics in isolation, but on **making defensible decisions when data is imperfect, constrained, or noisy**. I am particularly interested in how models behave under real-world conditions, and when a “better” model can actually be more misleading.

I bring a systems and operations background into analytics work, which shapes how I frame problems, interpret outputs, and decide what *not* to optimise.

## How to Read This GitHub

This GitHub is not a gallery of experiments.

It is a record of:
- How I approach analytical trade-offs
- How I reason under constraint
- How I choose clarity and stability over superficial performance

Some repositories are technical. Others are reflective.  
The unifying theme is **judgement over novelty**.

## Primary Artefact

### Model Selection Under Constraint  
📌 https://github.com/GazaliAhmad/diabetes-ml-faceoff

A case study on choosing a model when accuracy is not the primary goal.

This project documents:
- Why certain statistically attractive models were rejected
- How interpretability, stability, and failure modes shaped the final decision
- How small, ambiguous datasets change what “good” modelling means

This is the best entry point if you want to understand how I think.

## Supporting Work (Contextual)

The following repositories provide supporting context and execution capability:

- **Titanic Survival & Economic Analysis**  
  An exploration of how variables gain meaning only when interpreted within economic and social context.

- **COVID-19 Trend Analysis**  
  A practical exercise in cleaning and analysing messy, real-world public health data.

- **AI Persona Design (Dr Greyson Rouhe)**  
  An experiment in behavioural constraint, guardrails, and controlled LLM interaction.

These projects are not presented as highlights, but as **evidence of breadth and execution**.

## Background (Brief)

My background spans operations, systems support, and analytics.  
This includes time in frontline roles, enterprise systems environments, and structured analytical work.

That trajectory is not incidental. It is why I treat data as something *produced by systems*, not something that exists in abstraction.

---

## Current Focus

I am open to roles involving:
- Data Analytics
- Systems / Business Analysis
- Context-heavy analytical work where judgement matters

Particularly in environments where data quality, constraints, and operational trade-offs are real.
