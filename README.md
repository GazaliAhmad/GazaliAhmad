# Hi there, I'm Gazali Ahmad 👋
### 📊 Data Analyst | Systems & Operational Background

I am a Data Analyst with a unique background in **Systems Support (Synapxe)** and **Operations**. Unlike typical analysts who only see rows and columns, I understand the physical systems, log files, and operational workflows that generate the data.

I specialize in **Operational Analytics**: cleaning messy real-world data, auditing system logic, and using economic context to validate machine learning models.

## 🎯 Strategic Self-Audit
I believe in treating my own career like a data project. I recently conducted a "Gap Analysis" to benchmark my Systems Support background against Data Analyst requirements.

* [**View the full Analysis & Fitment Radar**](https://github.com/GazaliAhmad/data-analyst-role-fitment)
* **Key Insight:** My 10+ years in Operations give me a massive advantage in **Problem Framing** and **Stakeholder Management** compared to fresh graduates, while I have aggressively upskilled in Python to close the technical gap.
