# Hi, I’m Gazali Ahmad

I am a Systems Analyst working at the intersection of data analysis, systems thinking, and operational reality, particularly in contexts where decisions must hold up under constraint, scrutiny, and imperfect data (e.g. healthcare, public systems, and regulated environments).

My focus is not on maximizing metrics in isolation, but on reducing decision risk when data is noisy, limited, or produced by complex real-world systems. I am especially interested in situations where a statistically “better” model can create false confidence and lead to fragile or misleading outcomes.

## How to Read This GitHub

This GitHub is not a gallery of experiments or optimization exercises.

It is a record of how I:

- Reason under operational and data constraints  
- Evaluate analytical trade-offs and failure modes  
- Prioritize interpretability, stability, and decision integrity over superficial performance  

Some repositories are technical. Others focus on analytical judgment.  
The unifying theme is **process integrity over headline metrics**.

## Primary Case: Model Selection Under Constraint

### Model Selection Under Constraint  
📌 https://github.com/GazaliAhmad/diabetes-ml-faceoff

This case study examines model selection in a healthcare-adjacent context where interpretability, stability, and decision risk matter more than marginal accuracy gains.

The work documents:

- How failure modes and interpretability shaped the final model choice  
- Why statistically attractive models were rejected due to risk and fragility  
- How small, ambiguous datasets change what “good” modeling actually means in practice  

The emphasis is not on model performance alone, but on whether the model’s behavior would remain defensible under real-world scrutiny.

This repository best reflects how I make analytical decisions when outcomes matter.

## Supporting Evidence (Capability Context)

The following repositories provide supporting context for my analytical and systems capability:

### Titanic Survival & Economic Analysis  
Demonstrates how variables gain meaning only when interpreted within economic and social context, rather than treated as isolated predictors.

### COVID-19 Reporting Artefacts & False Signals  
Examines global COVID-19 datasets to identify reporting distortions, boundary misalignment, and false causal assumptions commonly produced by public health data.

The analysis highlights how delayed disclosure, administrative aggregation, and proxy variables (e.g. hospital beds, smoking prevalence) can generate misleading conclusions if treated as direct epidemiological signals.

The emphasis is on preventing confident but incorrect conclusions, rather than maximizing descriptive completeness.

### AI Persona Design (Dr. Greyson Rouhe)  
Explores behavioral constraints, guardrails, and controlled interaction in LLM systems, with an emphasis on safety, failure modes, and predictable system behavior.

These projects are not presented as highlights, but as **evidence of breadth, execution, and judgment across domains**.

## Background (Brief)

My background spans frontline operations, enterprise systems support, system integration, and applied analytics.

This trajectory is intentional. It is why I treat data as something generated by systems and human behavior, not as an abstract artifact detached from operational reality.

## Current Focus

I am open to roles involving:

- Systems Analysis  
- Applied analytics in operational or regulated environments  
- Context-heavy analytical work where judgment, constraint, and decision integrity matter
